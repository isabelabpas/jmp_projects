# No place like stats 💡
I absolutely love statistical testing. During my undergraduate Econometrics and Statistics courses, I utilized SPSS and Stata, but my first exposure to JMP happened very recently. Still getting the hang of it but very straightforward! 🪄

Here you can find my projects centered in employing JMP SAS.

• 💵 [Analysis on Salary Variations](https://github.com/isabelabpas/jmp_projects/tree/6f0354de177c899f95f0642c7b621cca1fb00cb2/JMP%20Salary%20Analysis): In this project, I utilized JMP software to analyze salary variations among over 20,000 technology sales representatives. I conducted statistical analyses, including correlation analysis and ANOVA, to examine the impact of demographic factors and performance metrics on salaries. This project focused on leveraging data-driven methods to identify key determinants for compensation strategies and hiring processes.  
  
• 📘 [Clustering Analysis on Study Habits](https://github.com/isabelabpas/jmp_projects/blob/main/Analysis%20on%20Study%20Habits.md): In this project, I applied hierarchical clustering techniques in JMP to analyze the dietary habits of 150 students based on their macronutrient intake. I performed data preparation, cluster generation, and statistical validation through ANOVA to identify distinct groupings in the dataset. This project highlights my ability to use clustering as a tool for exploring behavioral patterns in nutrition.  
  
• 🍴 [Clustering Analysis on Dietary Patterns](https://github.com/isabelabpas/jmp_projects/blob/main/Analysis%20on%20Student%20Dietary%20Patterns.md): In this project, I used JMP software to perform K-Means clustering on behavioral data from 500 high school students. I focused on analyzing patterns in time allocation for homework and leisure activities. The project involved generating clusters, exploring data, and validating the model to uncover meaningful group behaviors.
