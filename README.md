# No place like stats ðŸ’¡
I absolutely love statistical testing. During my undergraduate Econometrics and Statistics courses, I utilized SPSS and Stata, but my first exposure to JMP happened very recently. Still getting the hang of it but very straightforward! ðŸª„

Here you can find my projects centered in employing JMP SAS.
